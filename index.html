                    I'm <strong style="color: rgb(213 222 54);">Micheal</strong>. Thank you for taking the time to peruse my portfolio made specifically for Centennial College!
                    I'm an American, and I've lived in Ontario for a little under a year.
                    My hobbies are video games, music, fitness, and (predictably) web development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Until recently I was a graduate student studying Linguisitcs at Western University.
                    After realizing that I felt more at home in computer science classes than in Linguistcs classes, I decided to change my career trajectory
                    from academia to tech. Since then, I've been working <strong><em>every single day</em></strong> to make that happen.

                        I'm very proud of what I have learned in the past few months,
                        and consider it to be a testament to my grit and commitment to learning.
                        While I came into web development with a rudimentary knowledge of Python and HTML,
                        I have since become able to use JavaScript (and several libraries), Java, CSS.
                        Presenting all of my sites in this order hopefully illustrates just how far I have come in a short amount of time.
                        <strong>Here are some of the projects I have made between April 24th, 2022 and July 15th, 2022:</strong>

                                This is my first site made during a 4 hour CSS crash course.
                                It's supposed to be a "Coming Soon" page, but I had a little bit of fun making it more personalized.
                                Each picture links to a website about the character.

                                    The user plays a first-to-five game of Rock Paper Scissors with the computer,
                                    with the results of each game being displayed to the user.

                                A JavaScript calculator. The hardest part was figuring out how to incorporate features standard to calculators rather than figuring out
                                how to calculate. I opted to store the operands as variables rather than brute forcing them with an array because it made implementing other features easier.

                                    The first JavaScript project that truly challenged me. The user uses their mouseclicks to draw an image on the canvas.
                                    They are able to control what color they use, whether the gridlines are on, and select fun options like "gamer mode"
                                    (the colors become randomized) and a "gradient mode" that adds 0.1 opacity per click.
                                    The user can also resize their canvas up to 100 squares. This is done by dynamically altering the divs within the canvas, and reattaching event listeners.
                                    <strong>I also made the fonts!</strong>

                                This is my personal page that is still a work in progress. However, I thought it was worth showing since the animations are done entirely in JavaScript! On the actual live version
                                of the site, the teeth closing animation will load another HTML document inside of the iframe (instead of just "hi there!").
                                The page is supposed to be reminiscent of sites from the early 2000's, and I took a lot of inspiration from my favorite artists
                                to create the aesthetic. All animations (the eyes tracking the div the user hovers over, the teeth closing, the shape moving in the left corner) were done by me.

                I have had a great deal of time to consider what I want out of a career, and I have found what I'm looking for in web development.
                My interest was sparked by two things: My discovery of my love of coding, and my realization that it is important for me to have something to show for time invested in a project.
                Web development hits both of those two points while also allowing me to be creative both in my approach to aesthetics and problem solving -- I only recently realized how deeply important
                the latter is to me.

                The fast-track Software Engineering Technician program at Centennial seemed perfectly aligned with this. While I have done much on
                my own to put me closer to my professional goals, I'm confident the structure provided by Centennial would help push my knowledge to the next level
                and help prepare me for the workplace. The two-semester time period in tandem with the material covered gives me the assurance that this program is the best
                fit for me.

                of topics I needed to know. I studied SQL, JavaScript (and some associated libraries), Java, HTML, CSS, and the SDLC to adequately prepare.
                In the past several months I have spent six to ten hours a day studying these topics
                to build the strongest case for my enrollment in the program. I found syllabi and textbooks for some of the prerequisite courses, and worked through them (as was the case with SQL), enrolled in courses through Centennial (as I did to learn Java).
                I enrolled in online courses where I could not find course information. I am confident that my knowledge and background is enough for me to excel at Centennial. I believe that after reviewing this website you will too.
